As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.19.5 or higher.

Additions:
* Add compacted crafting plan viewing mode

  This groups all missing and available ingredients per type,
  which is more convenient to view at a glance what the problems are for
  large and nested crafting jobs.

  This is shown by default over the old tree-based view, but can be
  toggled in-game.
  This default can be changed using the `terminalStorageDefaultToCraftingPlanTree`
  config option.

  The tree-based view will be unavailable for very large crafting jobs as
  it causes packets to become too large. The threshold for this can be
  modified using the `terminalStorageMaxTreePlanSize` config option.

  Closes CyclopsMC/IntegratedTerminals#14
  Closes CyclopsMC/IntegratedDynamics#1341

Changes:
* Remove unused crafting plan in HandlerWrappedTerminalCraftingPlan
