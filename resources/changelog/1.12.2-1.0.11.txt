Requires CyclopsCore version 1.4.0 or higher.

Fixes:
* Render items using vanilla RenderItem
  Only the overlays are now rendered with our custom RenderItem.
  This is to be compatible with mods that coremod into RenderItem,
  such as GregTech, and where their items are otherwise not rendering.
  Closes #43
